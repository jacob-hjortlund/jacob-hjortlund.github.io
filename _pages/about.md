I'm a MSc student at the [DARK section at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen](https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/) (2021/2024). My current research interests are in the field of observational cosmology, with a focus on Type Ia supernovae and their use as cosmological distance indicators. My [MSc thesis](https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/) was focused on hierarchical modelling of Type Ia supernovae using a novel two-population approach to improve supernovae standardization. I'm also interested in the use of machine learning techniques for upcoming surveys such as LSST. I am part of the LSST [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) and [Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration (TVS)](https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/), where I'm currently working on a novel semi-supervised probabilistic machine learning model for photometric redshift estimation.

Previously, I was a BSc student at the University of Copenhagen, where I completed two degrees, one in [Physics](https://studier.ku.dk/bachelor/fysik/) (2017/2020) and one in [Machine Learning and Data Science](https://studier.ku.dk/bachelor/machine-learning-og-datavidenskab/) (2020/2021). During my time as a BSc student I was heavily engaged in the student community, participating in the student council and as a tutor for new undergraduate students.

In between my Bsc and MSc degrees I worked as a machine learning engineer at the Danish medtech company [Corti AI](https://www.corti.ai/) (2021/2022), where I worked on improving in-house speech recognition models for emergency calls and cardiac arrest detection. In addition to my work on speech recognition, I also worked on automatic optimization of call-taker protocols to improve the quality of emergency calls.

In my spare time I enjoy bouldering, skateboarding, and reading. I'm also a big fan of cooking, and you'll often find me in the kitchen trying out some new fermentation project.
